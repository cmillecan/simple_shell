# Simple Shell

## Project Overview
This is the final project for the first trimester at Holberton School. We created a simple shell using the C programming language.

## Program Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md file`, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to
